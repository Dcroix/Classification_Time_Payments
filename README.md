Every business that invoices customers faces one common challenge:
- ✅ Ensuring invoices are paid on time.
- ⚠️ Late payments can disrupt cash flow, increase administrative costs, and affect the company’s ability to operate efficiently.

"We Provide All", a mid-sized B2B service provider, issues hundreds of invoices monthly to clients across various industries. Some clients pay promptly, while others consistently delay payments. The Operations Department want to anticipate payment delays so they can take preventive action such as early reminders, offering discounts, or adjusting payment terms.

The QUESTION relevant to the business problem is simple but impactful:
## “Can we predict whether a customer will pay their next invoice on time?”

By identifying invoices at risk of late payment, the company can:
- 🎯Improve cash flow forecasting
- 🎯Prioritize follow-up actions for at-risk customers
- 🎯Offer proactive incentives or flexible payment plans
- 🎯Reduce overdue receivables and collection costs

This transforms a reactive collections process into a data-driven, proactive operation.
